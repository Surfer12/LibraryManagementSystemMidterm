/* Design a Library Management System that allows:
    Students to borrow and return books.
    Librarians to manage user accounts (create, update, delete... etc) and keep track of book availability and due dates.
    Users to search for books by title, author, or ISBN.

Provide a class diagram illustrating the main classes, their attributes, and relationships. Specifically:

Include an abstract User class with relevant attributes.
Have Librarian and Student classes inherit from the User class.
Design a Book class with appropriate attributes.
Include any other necessary classes to represent the system's functionality.
